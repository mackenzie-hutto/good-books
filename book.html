While attempting to adjusts from the big city to a small rural country town and trying to save a declining football program after the deaths of three of their football players, Andrew Hanson uncovers several clues which aids his father, Assistance Police Chief Scott Hanson, in solving several murders that has devastated the small town of Clarksville, Arizona. It*s a modern day western with all the elements: cowboys, Indians, horses, rodeos an upstanding hero (Andrew), a pure but hurting heroine (Shayla), criminals, lawmen, gunfire, coyotes and mountain lions, bears, etc. But it also has modern elements no Old West western has—football games, school dances, hot rods, cruising main, cell phones and drug dealers. [The Presence of Justice] is much more than a simple murder mystery; it*s a love story, and modern day western with strong family ties and a very surprising ending."'>more on [The Presence of Justice]</button>
